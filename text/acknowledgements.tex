I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Martin Wirsing for giving me the opportunity to prove my motivation in writing a my thesis about what I considered would suit me best. I thank my supervisor Joscha Bach, for giving me the opportunity to work with his creation, advising and inspiring me through the entire process.
I especially thank my supervisor Annabelle Klarl, for supporting my plan without hesitation, guiding me through the process and providing valuable feedback whenever I needed it. Dominik Welland helped me with understanding and building upon the MicroPsi framework and fixed inhabitant bugs as soon as I reported them, thank you!

Additionally I would like to thank Michael Fogleman and especially Nick Gamberini who's code I built upon and who answered every question about his Spock in detail. Finally, I thank all the other members of the Minecraft community, who collect and distribute structured knowledge regarding the game in an combined effort and answered my questions about the game and how it works it IRCs and message boards.
