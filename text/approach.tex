\chapter{A! Approach / Minecraft as a Simulation Environment for MicroPsi 2}

The objective of this thesis is to build and test an interface in between MicroPsi and Minecraft, so that a Minecraft world (e.g. server) can be used as a simulation environment for the MicroPsi 2 Framework, which will act as an artificial player.

That being said, a big part of the project is about visualization. Inside the MicroPsi Core Application, a 3D-visualization of the Minecraft world and the agent within is aimed for. There are two main reasons for this goal. The first reason is, that the agents behavior within the simulation environment is supposed to be monitored from the MicroPsi webinterface in an aesthetically appealing way. The secons reason is, that the image data is supposed to be processed by the agent as one of it's senses.

The functionality is to be tested with a simple Braitenberg-vehicle experiment.

Do obtain these goals, the Minecraft Client-Server-Protocol had to be researched, learned and imitated.

Then, artificial Minecraft players (written in Python) had to be searched, found and researched.

Eventually, building upon an existing Bot framework led to an integration with the MicroPsi framework.

\section{A! Implementation}
% TODO je nach Größe des Kapitels, das hier vielleicht eine Ebene höher ziehen (versuche dich hier erstmal nur auf die fertige Lösung zu konzentrieren und warum du dich dafür entschieden hast. Es ist nicht interessant, was du sonst alles ausprobiert hast, außer dass du konkret angibst, warum du dich für die jetztige Implementierung im Vergleich zu anderen entschieden hast)
