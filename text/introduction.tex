\chapter{Introduction}
% TODO Die Introduction fängt gut an, aber MicroPsi fällt mir zu sehr vom Himmel. Du solltest in der Introduction wirklich nur motivierend bleiben, warum will man so was wie MicroPsi haben, warum braucht man Simulationsumgebungen, keine Details zur MicroPsi-Implementierung oder Minecraft. Das kommt erst im Kapitel Foundations (dort kannst du den Text wahrscheinlich ziemlich so bringen, wie er in der Motivation steht)! 
The hunt for artificial intelligence started many years ago. Dividing the subject into the strong and weak part means seperating its goals into usefull applications and those that try to learn about the nature of intelligence itself. The ultimate task of strong A.I. --- recreating human intelligence --- admitably still seems to be science fiction, though.

But then again: a new generation of cognitive scientists, psychologists and computer scientists strives to implement new Ideas for simulated cognition --- building cognitive architectures. Many of them do so by simulating, in one way or the other, what could be called "neural networks(/nodenets)".

One of these architectures is MicroPsi 2. Developed by Joscha Bach, it is based on the Psi Theory by Dietrich Dörner, who is a german Professor for theoretical psychology. It aims at providing a solid and complete implementation of that theory of cognition and at beeing easily accesible, understandable and modifiable for the research and applications to come.

To test the functionality of such cognitive architectures and to figure out their capabilities and potential, we need to research their behavior inside defined environemts. As implementing AI into the physical world (as robots for examples) requires building apropriate hardware and patience, computer-simulated environments therefore play an important role.

MicroPsi 2 is both: a cognitive architecture but also a set of and an interface to simulation environments.

\section{Motivation}
Video games are natural applications of artificial intelligence. The quality of a games A.I. can make all the difference in between a great title and an uninspired demo of computer graphics technology.

Building an interface between the cognitive architecture MicroPsi 2 and a video game world is what this Thesis is about.
